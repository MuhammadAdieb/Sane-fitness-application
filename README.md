Android app development project
This is a project which I developed as a summer internship project in my graduation(BCA).
I and my team used android studio app to develop this app.
We used Javaswing as front end , and APIs to develop this project.
The aim for developing this project is to add fitness to life of the working peoples.
The project is based on recommending exercises to the people with different professions and have a varying lifestyles.
For each profession our app recommend different exercices for them to be fit.
